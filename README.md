## Project Description
*The focus of our project was to create a collaborative MVP product.*

The MVP we've created is a digital service (web-app) that can benefit a person in lockdown or in social isolation. The app aims to provide group support for a person in a situation of social distancing. It aims to create a safe space for one in need of emotional peer-support. 

## Challenges

* The main focus as group was to create a cohesive product that brought together all of our individual talents as web designers and developers. 

* Due to time restrictions, our team was not able to include JS for better functionality.

## Areas to complete:
* Additional media-quarry functionality
* JS for better user experience  
* Additional development of personal insight area (journal) as well as motivational tips area.
